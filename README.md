My second Ludum Dare project! You must get beneath the surface of the space station to retrieve the hidden gold/core/important item! 

I am very happy with how this turned out. Every hour the game kept getting better and feeling more complete, and I'm quite proud of the final result. 

This is my first project since learning about object pooling, though I was bad and didn't make use of it in the project. Every couple hours I would think to myself "man... this feature would be perfect for object pooling."

Anyway, I hope you find my game as fun as I do! :)

Controls
------------
wasd or arrow keys = movement
space = fire

Supports 360 controller. Controls should be relatively obvious.
